# memtier_skewsyn (Under Construction)

Memcached skew and colocation workload benchmarking tool, modified from
[memtier_benchmark](https://github.com/RedisLabs/memtier_benchmark).
This repo contains two major branches:
the original memtier_benchmark with `loadonly.sh` script (`master` branch);
and the skew & colocation benchmark we used for the paper
(`skewSynthetic` branch).

## Note
If you are going to reproduce the experiments (especially with background video
task), please contact us.
